# [QWorld](https://qworld.net)'s Bronze-ProjectQ

**Bronze** is our introductory tutorial on _**quantum computing and quantum programming**_ created in October 2018.

**Bronze-ProjectQ** is the version of Bronze using [**ProjectQ**](hhttps://projectq.ch) as the quantum programming framework. It was released with the support of [**Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.**](https://www.huawei.com/en) in October 2021.

Bronze is a collection of Jupyter notebooks, and each notebook has many programming tasks to provide hands-on experiences. We see Bronze as a laboratory where you can learn the basics of quantum computing and quantum programming by doing. Bronze has already been used in more than 60 workshops ([the most recent list](http://qworld.net/workshop-bronze/#list)) under QWorld. As a pedagogical strategy, we skip to use complex numbers to keep the tutorial simpler. 

## Prerequisite

The only prerequisite is to know the basics of programming (variables and basic data types, loops, and conditionals). Any previous experience in python will be helpful. If you do not have any such experince, you can check our notebooks on python before starting the tutorial.

Bronze has notebooks on the basic math to review your knowledge on the basic operations on vectors and matrices.

## Bronze-ProjectQ's sections

- Python (for a quick review)
- Basic math (for a quick review)
- Classical systems: bits, coin-flipping, probabilistic state and operators, composite systems, correlation, and controlled operators
- Quantum systems with ProjectQ
    - ProjectQ basics: circuit design, visualization, and simulation
    - quantum basics: quantum coin-flipping and Hadamard operator, quantum states and opeators, visualization of a real-valued qubit, superposition and measurements
    - quantum operators on a real-valued single qubit (rotations and reflections) and quantum tomography
    - entanglement and basic quantum protocols superdense coding and quantum teleportation
    - Grover's search algorithm

## Credits

Bronze was created by [Abuzer Yakaryilmaz](http://abu.lu.lv) (QWorld & QLatvia) in October 2018, and it has been developed and maintained by him. 

Özlem Salehi Köken (QWorld & QTurkey) and Maksims Dimitrijevs (QWorld & QLatvia) are the other contributors by preparing new notebooks and revising the existing notebooks.

Bronze was publicly available on July 7, 2019.

ProjectQ adaptation was done by Vishal Sharathchandra Bajpe, Marija Šćekić, and Abuzer Yakaryilmaz between June and October 2021.

### Video lectures

The recording lectures for classical systems were prepared by Abuzer Yakaryilmaz in August 2020.

The installation recording was prepared by Vishal Sharathchandra Bajpe in October 2021.

### Bronze-ProjectQ 2021

Agnieszka Wolska prepared the new graphics and logos.

The installation instructions was prepared by Vishal Sharathchandra Bajpe.

We thank Claudia Zendejas-Morales and Kenneth Isamade to make some revisions of the quantum parts before using it during [QBronze69](https://qworld.net/qbronze69-china-october-2021/) workshop.
